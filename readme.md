# Notifier

This simple program lets you create Lua scripts to perform various tasks. You could e.g. create a script to look at some website and check if there is something specifically important for you in the announcements section. If so, the script can create a notification, so that the user will be informed. Each script can run code continually, at specified time intervals.

Currently the program doesn't feature any GUI other than the context menu inside the notification area:
